2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions granted by default
3. **Zero Trust Architecture**: All requests authenticated and authorized
4. **Secure by Default**: Security controls enabled out of the box

### Code Quality Standards

- **Code Review**: All changes require peer review before merge
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security and quality scanning
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end test coverage
- **Documentation**: API documentation and inline code comments

### Compliance Framework

GatewayOps is designed with enterprise compliance requirements in mind:

- SOC 2 Type II alignment
- GDPR data protection principles

## Methodology

### Development Process

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Security and functional requirements defined upfront
2. **Threat Modeling**: Security risks identified and mitigated by design
3. **Implementation**: Secure coding practices with automated checks
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive security and functional testing
5. **Deployment**: Secure CI/CD pipelines with artifact signing
6. **Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring and incident response

### API Design Principles

- RESTful design patterns
- Consistent error handling and response formats
- Versioned APIs for backward compatibility
- Rate limiting and throttling by default
- Comprehensive request/response logging

### Data Handling
