Problem: AI agents calling tools without oversight

- No audit trail
- No access control
- No cost tracking
- No security policies

It's the wild west out there.

Solution: GatewayOps sits between your agents and MCP servers

Every tool call flows through the gateway:

-> Authentication
-> Authorization
-> Safety checks
-> Execution
-> Logging
-> Metrics

Full observability. Zero code changes.
```

## Hacker News Post

**Title:** Show HN: GatewayOps - Open source enterprise gateway for MCP AI agents

**Text:**
```
Hey HN,

I built GatewayOps to solve a problem we kept hitting: AI agents calling tools without any oversight.

With Claude, ChatGPT, and others now supporting tool use, we needed a way to:
- Know what tools agents are calling
- Control who can call what
- Detect and block malicious prompts
- Track costs across teams
- Meet compliance requirements

GatewayOps is a gateway that sits in front of your MCP servers. Every tool call flows through it, giving you complete visibility and control.

Key features:
- SSO/OIDC (Okta, Azure AD, Google)
- Role-based access control
- Prompt injection detection
- Tool approval workflows
- Cost tracking
- Real-time dashboard
- OpenTelemetry export

It's a single Go binary with SDKs for Python and TypeScript.

Tech stack: Go, PostgreSQL, Redis, Next.js

Try it: gatewayops.com
GitHub: github.com/akz4ol/gatewayops

Would love feedback from anyone running AI agents in production.
```

Hi Product Hunt!

I'm the creator of GatewayOps. We built this because we kept running into the same problem: AI agents calling tools without any oversight.

As more companies deploy AI agents in production, they need:
- Audit trails for compliance
- Access controls for security
- Cost tracking for budgets
- Safety checks for trust

GatewayOps provides all of this as a simple gateway layer. Drop it in front of your MCP servers and you're done.

Happy to answer any questions!
